# Coin-Picking-Game
It models a simple multi-player game. Coins are scattered probabilistically in the world. As people move around, they automatically pick up any coins at their location. When one person bumps into another, the bumper steals all the bumpee's coins.

The problem uses typical 2D (x,y) spatial coordinates.
The x axis extends horizontally, increasing right/east. The y axis extends vertically, increasing up/north.
